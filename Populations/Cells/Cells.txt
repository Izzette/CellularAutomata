file: ICell: public interface ICell:
			
	All base and abstract Cells classes inherit.

	ICell GetNext ():

		Depends on base.next: null until added to prvent infinite search loop risk
		
		returns next ICell in scan.

	int GetState ():

		returns state

	void SetState (int state):
		
		sets state.
		
	int GetNeighbourhood (int color):

		color is the number of colors.
		returns neighbourhood.
		
	Aranagements GetArangement ():
	
		returns Arangements enum
	
All base and abstract class members contain the following static methods or constructors:

	public static ICell[] Build (int[] size, int[] values):
		
		Creates network of cells in specified size with specified values.
		Size is safed with manual exceptions.
		return items.
		
	public static ICell[] Build (int[] size, out int[] values):

		Constructs int[] values with simple seed.
		size safed with manual exceptions.
		Overload for this (int[] size, int[] values).
		return items.
		
	public this (int state):

		Constructs new cell with given state.
		All links to this.

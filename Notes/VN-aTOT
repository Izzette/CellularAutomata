2D Von Neumann Wolfram Code:
k = 2; code 76 {
	From a simple seed, a repeating fractal-like pattern is acheived.  The pattern symetrically fills the universe with unique and complex geometric patterns.  The patterns repeatedly die after reaching a high density leaving behind a new set of symetrical simple seeds.  As the population repeatedly "dies off", the emerging patterns seem to gradually increase in complexity.
}

k = 3; code 630 {
	From a simple seed "1", a simple ordered pattern (w/o "2") is attained as a front propogates away from the initial seed.  When the fronts meet, a complex pattern emerges includeing "2".  After the complexity fills the universe, it does not seem to progress further.  However, many approximations of a circle and various other curves appear.  Amazing how this can occur in a purely perpendicular universe.
